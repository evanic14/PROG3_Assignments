# Data set scaling functions

"Most of the times, your dataset will contain features highly varying in magnitudes, units and range. ... we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. This can be achieved by scaling." 

See for some examples: [scaling](https://medium.com/greyatom/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e).
